  "description": "So what exactly is a webhook? By definition, a webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediatelyâ€”unlike typical APIs where you would need to poll for data very frequently to get it in real time.",
