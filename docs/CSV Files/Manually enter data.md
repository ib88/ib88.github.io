# Manually enter data

Manually entering data has its own importance over uploading a CSV file in certain situations. While uploading a CSV file may save time and effort in some cases, manually entering data has the following advantages:

1. Avoiding Errors: Manually entering data allows the user to spot and fix errors on the spot. Errors in CSV files can cause data integrity issues that can go unnoticed, leading to larger problems down the road.

2. Improved Understanding of Data Structure: When manually entering data, the user has a better understanding of the data structure and format. This can lead to better analysis and more accurate conclusions.

3. Quality Control: Manually entering data offers the opportunity to enforce data entry standards and perform quality control measures.

4. Security and Confidentiality: Manually entered data can ensure security and confidentiality of sensitive data by reducing the risk of data being exposed through file sharing. 

In summary, manually entering data may be more time-consuming, but it provides better data accuracy, improves data analysis, improves quality control, and offers more security and confidentiality of sensitive data.
