## What is a CSV file?
__CSV files__ are text files with information separated by commas, saved with the extension . csv. They allow large amounts of detailed data to be transferred 'machine-to-machine', with little or no reformatting by the user.
For instance, it may look like the following:

```
- Name,email,phone number,address.  
 Example,example@example.com,555-555-5555,Example Address.  
 Example2,example2@example.com,555-555-5551,Example2 Address  
```
