#  Introduction

__SimplyCSV__ is an intuitive tool that provides you with an intuitive way to deal with CSV files. Most of the times, users have to write codes in order to do csv files operations. Our goal is to allow non programmers to be able to use an interface to handle __csv__ files.

## What is a CSV file?
__CSV files__ are text files with information separated by commas, saved with the extension . csv. They allow large amounts of detailed data to be transferred 'machine-to-machine', with little or no reformatting by the user.
For instance, it may look like the following:

```
- Name,email,phone number,address.  
 Example,example@example.com,555-555-5555,Example Address.  
 Example2,example2@example.com,555-555-5551,Example2 Address  
```
