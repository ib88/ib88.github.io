# Create a Webhook

 So what exactly is a webhook? By definition, a webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediatelyâ€”unlike typical APIs where you would need to poll for data very frequently to get it in real time.
 You would create a template and get notified whenever a file is uploaded. That way, you can know when a file has been uploaded so that you can download it.
In this page, we show you how to attach a Webhook to a template using Codes.

This snippet of codes create a webhook.
```
    $createAttributes = $request->only(['url']);
        $endpoint = $template->webhookEndpoints()->create($createAttributes);

        return new WebhookEndpointResource($endpoint);
 ```

 Here, we use the template object __$template__ to access its webhookEndpoints. We then call the __create()__ method passing in the attributes __$createAttributes__ as argument.
