# What is a CSV template?


CSV (Comma Separated Values) templates are files that are used to store information in a structured format that can be easily imported and exported from various software applications. CSV templates consist of data organized into rows and columns, with each column having a unique identifier, also commonly referred to as a field or header.

## Templates use cases
The primary use case for CSV templates is in data migration or data import/export processes where there is a need to transfer data from one system to another. For example, an e-commerce company might use a CSV template to upload its inventory to a platform like Amazon or Shopify.

CSV templates also find widespread use in accounting and financial management. Accounting software such as QuickBooks or Xero allows users to export their accounting data into CSV templates, which can then be imported into spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. 

Other use cases for CSV templates include:

- Creating customer or vendor lists for sales or marketing purposes.
- Creating bulk email templates.
- Managing employee records.
- Creating and uploading product catalogs to online marketplaces.
- Exporting information from one database to another.
