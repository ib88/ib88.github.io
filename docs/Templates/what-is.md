# What is a template?


A template is a form, mold or pattern used as a guide to make something.

## Examples of template use cases
Let's take a deeper look at some of the numerous applications for templates.

- Documents. Document templates typically contain placeholder text or a standard layout that should be repeated for each new file created. Thus, the template allows users to reuse certain standard section of text and simply fill in the variable parts rather than create an entirely new document every time.
- Website design. With a general design template, users can then change the color scheme, images and text to create a unique website without starting from scratch.
- Programming flowcharts. In programming, a template can be used to create Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams like activity diagrams, class diagrams and sequence diagrams. There is also the Standard Template Library for object oriented computing languages, such as the - - - Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library from which programmers can choose individual template classes to modify.
- Material patterns. Templates are often used in woodworking, sewing and other physical crafting projects to ensure that pieces are cut out of materials correctly.
