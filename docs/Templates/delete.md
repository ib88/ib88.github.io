# Delete a template
Deleting a CSV template may be important for several reasons. 

Firstly, it can prevent the accidental usage of old or outdated templates, which can result in the incorrect input or processing of data. Deleting old templates can help ensure that only the most recent and accurate version is used. 

Additionally, deleting templates can aid in data security and privacy. If a template contains sensitive information, such as personal or financial data, deleting it can prevent unauthorized access or exposure. 

Furthermore, deleting templates can help to keep your files organized and avoid clutter. By removing unnecessary files, you can free up storage space and make it easier to find the files that you need. 

In summary, deleting a CSV template can be important for accuracy, security, privacy, and organization purposes.
