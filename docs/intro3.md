## Technical Aspects:

SimplyCSV is a web-based application that utilizes a combination of client-side JavaScript and server-side programming to provide a streamlined and user-friendly experience for users. The application is built on the Node.js framework and utilizes the popular Express.js library for handling HTTP requests and responses.

The registration process is handled by a combination of client-side and server-side programming. When the user submits the registration form, the data is sent to the server where it is validated and then stored in a database. Once the user's account is activated, they can log in to SimplyCSV and access all of our features.
